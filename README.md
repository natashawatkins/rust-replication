# Rust (1987) replication

These Jupyter notebooks replicate the main results from Rust (1987) using raw data sourced from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3385050#.YjTy3C-B1QI). For convenience, the data is located in the folder `nxfp`.

There are two notebooks:
* `rust.ipynb` solves the model using Numba to speed up computation
* `rust-jax.ipynb` solves the model using JAX to speed up computation (this is faster but less intuitive)

These materials are uploaded to help future IO students!
