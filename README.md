# Rust (1987) replication

These Jupyter notebooks replicate the main results from Rust (1987) using raw data contained in the folder `nxfp`.

There are two notebooks:
* `rust.ipynb` solves the model using Numba to speed up computation
* `rust-jax.ipynb` solves the model using JAX to speed up computation (this is faster but less intuitive)
